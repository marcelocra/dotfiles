# Commands to run during system startup.
#
# To set them up, use Ubuntu's Startup Application app (also present in Linux
# Mint). Open the app and add a new command, pasting the path to this file.
#
# BE AWARE that simply doing that might not be enough, as sometimes the
# configurations only work if the desktop is fully loaded before they are
# applied.
#
# In those cases, add a delay to the command. Linux Mint provide a 'delay'
# option directly in the UI. If that's not the case for the distro you are
# using, do something like this:
# 
#   /bin/sh -c "sleep 3 && /path-to-this-file/init_system_linux.sh"
#
# For more details, take a look at: https://askubuntu.com/a/708043/121101.
#
# After setting that up, reboot the system and you should be good to go!

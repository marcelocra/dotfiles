# Project Summary: AI Development Container Scripts Refactoring

## Overview

Focused on creating and refactoring AI-enabled development container scripts. The goal was to provide easy-to-use scripts that spin up development containers with Claude Code and Gemini CLI pre-installed.

## Initial Requirements

The user requested:

1. Scripts that work with Podman containers
2. AI tools (Claude CLI and Gemini CLI) pre-installed
3. Development tools and useful aliases
4. Cross-platform support (Bash and PowerShell)
5. Minimal setup friction for developers

## Evolution of the Solution

### Phase 1: Initial Scripts Creation

- Created 3 individual bash scripts:
  - `dev-ai.sh` - Full development environment
  - `ai-dev.sh` - Quick development environment
  - `quick-ai` - Minimal Alpine-based environment
- Each script had inline installation logic
- Mixed Portuguese and English comments

### Phase 2: Code Quality Improvements

- Converted all comments and messages to English
- Used proper sentence endings with periods
- Prioritized Claude Code CLI (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- Switched to DevContainer images for better compatibility
- Added proper Gemini CLI package (`@google/gemini-cli`)

### Phase 3: Script Renaming and Standardization

- Renamed scripts to follow `ai-*.sh` pattern:
  - `dev-ai.sh` → `ai-full.sh`
  - `ai-dev.sh` → `ai-quick.sh`
  - `quick-ai` → `ai-minimal.sh`
- Added PowerShell version (`ai-dev.ps1`) with multi-mode support

### Phase 4: Architecture Refactoring (DRY Principle)

**Problem Identified**: Code duplication across scripts with identical installation logic.

**Solution**: Extracted installation logic into separate setup scripts:

- `setup-full.sh` - Complete development environment setup
- `setup-quick.sh` - Quick development environment setup
- `setup-minimal.sh` - Minimal environment setup

**Container runners updated** to use external setup scripts:

```bash
# Before: Inline installation code (50+ lines)
SETUP_CMD='apt-get install...; npm install...; echo "aliases"...'

# After: Clean external script reference (1 line)
SETUP_CMD='bash /workspace/setup-full.sh'
```

### Phase 5: Multi-Mode Consolidation

**Final optimization**: Created multi-mode scripts that replaced individual ones:

- `ai-dev.sh` (Bash multi-mode):

  ```bash
  ./ai-dev.sh          # quick mode (default)
  ./ai-dev.sh full     # full mode
  ./ai-dev.sh minimal  # minimal mode
  ```

- `ai-dev.ps1` (PowerShell multi-mode):
  ```powershell
  .\ai-dev.ps1 -Mode quick    # quick mode
  .\ai-dev.ps1 -Mode full     # full mode
  .\ai-dev.ps1 -Mode minimal  # minimal mode
  ```

**Removed individual scripts** (`ai-full.sh`, `ai-quick.sh`, `ai-minimal.sh`) as they were now redundant.

## Final Architecture

```
Container Runners          Setup Scripts (Shared Logic)
├── ai-dev.sh         ──→  setup-full.sh
└── ai-dev.ps1        ──→  setup-quick.sh
                      ──→  setup-minimal.sh
```

### Setup Scripts Features

| Script             | Target            | Base Image           | Tools                             | Features                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `setup-full.sh`    | Complete dev      | DevContainer JS-Node | tmux, fzf, zsh, fish, build tools | Advanced aliases, AI functions, project analysis |
| `setup-quick.sh`   | Essential dev     | DevContainer JS-Node | git, ripgrep, bat, exa, jq        | Essential aliases, AI executables                |
| `setup-minimal.sh` | Minimal footprint | Node Alpine          | Basic tools only                  | Simple aliases, basic AI functions               |

### Key Features Implemented

1. **AI Integration**:

   - Claude Code CLI with fallbacks
   - Gemini CLI with fallbacks
   - `ask "question"` function for Claude
   - `gemini "question"` function for Gemini

2. **Development Tools**:

   - Enhanced aliases (`ll`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`)
   - Git shortcuts (`gs`, `ga`, `gc`, `gp`, `gl`)
   - Modern CLI tools (ripgrep, bat, exa, fd)

3. **Cross-Platform Support**:

   - Bash scripts for Linux/macOS/WSL
   - PowerShell scripts for Windows/cross-platform
   - Identical functionality across platforms

4. **Container Configuration**:

   - SELinux-compatible volume mounts (`:Z` flag)
   - Proper environment variables
   - SSH key mounting for git operations
   - Claude/Gemini config mounting

## Benefits Achieved

1. **No Code Duplication**: Installation logic exists once per environment type
2. **Easy Maintenance**: Update one setup script affects all runners
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Same logic across bash and PowerShell versions
4. **Better UX**: Single script with mode parameters vs multiple scripts
5. **Modular Design**: Can mix setup scripts with different container configs
6. **Testable Architecture**: Setup scripts can be tested independently

## Documentation Created

- `README-AI-SCRIPTS.md` - User-facing documentation with usage examples
- `SETUP-SCRIPTS.md` - Technical architecture documentation
- Comprehensive usage examples and feature comparisons

## Final File Structure

```

├── ai-dev.sh            # Multi-mode bash runner
├── ai-dev.ps1           # Multi-mode PowerShell runner

├── setup-quick.sh       # Quick installation logic
├── setup-minimal.sh     # Minimal installation logic
└── README-AI-SCRIPTS.md # User documentation
```

## Technical Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple, Refactor Later**: Initial working scripts were better than perfect architecture from the start
2. **DRY Principle Saves Maintenance**: Extracting common logic prevented future maintenance nightmares
3. **Multi-Mode > Multiple Scripts**: Better UX with parameter-based modes than separate executables
4. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Same architecture patterns work well across bash and PowerShell
5. **Documentation is Critical**: Multiple documentation files helped track the evolution and final usage

This refactoring transformed a set of duplicate scripts into a clean, maintainable, and user-friendly architecture that follows software engineering best practices.

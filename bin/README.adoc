= bin

This folder contains some small binary programs that I find useful and want to keep handy.

Usually I symlink them to somewhere in my path (e.g. `~/bin`). In those cases, I don't include the full version in the symlink name, to facilitate usage from the cli. For example:

[sh]
----
ln -s $PWD/programs/minisign-0.11* $HOME/bin/minisign
----

ps.: despite the `.exe` extension, they are not meant for Windows.

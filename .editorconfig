# Options
# -------
#
#   root = true
#
#     EditorConfig looks for a file named `.editorconfig` in the directory of the current file and in every parent
#     directory. If it finds one that has `root = true`, it will stop looking.
#
#   indent_style: space | tab
#
#     When using `tab`, `tab_width` can be used to set the actual width, like `indent_size`. For example:
#     tab_width = 2
#
#     Note: Doesn't work in Sublime Text, as the main EditorConfig plugin doesn't implement it.
